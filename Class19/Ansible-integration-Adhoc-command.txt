In node1 machine

yum install wget git  -y

useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins

cat /etc/passwd | grep -i jenkins

passwd jenkins


in jenkins machine

su - -s /bin/bash jenkins
ssh-keygen
cat /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

now from jenkins machine try to copy the ssh keys to 2nd linux machine

ssh-copy-id node1


in jenkins machine as an root user

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg


inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts

[privilege_escalation]
become=True
become_method=sudo
become_user=root
become_ask_pass=False


vim /etc/ansible/hosts

node1

ansible all --list

In both machines (jenkins machine now also acting as an ansible machine and node1 which is ansible client)

visudo

jenkins ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL


in jenkins machine login as an jenkins user 

su - -s /bin/bash jenkins

ansible all --list


yum install https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/fedora/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/a/ansible-2.9.23-1.el7.noarch.rpm

[defaults]
inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts
remote_user=jenkins
[privilege_escalation]
become=True
become_method=sudo
become_user=root
become_ask_pass=False



Go to jenkins server cli prompt.Then run the following ansible ad-hoc command to make sure it is working

ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest"

ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent"


Host pattern --> node1
File or host list --> /etc/ansible/hosts
Module --> yum
Module arguments or command to execute --> name=httpd state=latest
